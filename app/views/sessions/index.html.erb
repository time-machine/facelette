  <p id="id-info">
    Your FaceTime ID is the number or email address you use for FaceTime. This
    will be made available to the person FaceTiming you. If you're on a Mac and
    want to be a little cautious, open FaceTime.app, go into
    File => Preferences, and create a new email address for this. You'll have to
    confirm it, so make sure it's not a complete phoney.
